## The Problem

John has 504 paving stones for an outdoor patio. He got the stones on the cheap because they were discontinued and he will not be able to get any more. Each stone measures 1 ft by 1 ft. John wants to use all the stones for his patio. What are all the possible dimensions for his patio?

## The Answer

504

$252*2$ -> 2

$126*2$ -> 2

$63*2$ -> 2

$21*3$ -> 3

$7*3$ -> 3

-> 7

$504 = 2*2*2*3*3*7$

$504 = 2^3*3^2*7$

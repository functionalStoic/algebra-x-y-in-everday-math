## Book description

>Algebra is all around us. Whether we realize it or not, it both represents and influences the world in a huge variety of ways-from the number of petals on a flower, to the interest rate on your mortgage. What's more, the language of mathematics and the ideas it expresses can be beautiful in their own right. Algebra: The x and y of Everyday Math takes you on a tour of the development of algebra and mathematics. On the way, you will meet fascinating figures and ideas from around the world, and you will also be faced with a range of problems to solve yourself.
